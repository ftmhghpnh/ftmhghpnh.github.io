bio: "I enjoy spending time in nature (for example hiking and kayaking), acquiring new skills (currently playing piano), reading books, and discovering new music on Spotify!"
about: "I am Fateme, (/fɑ:teme/), a M.Sc. student at the <a href=\"https://web.cs.toronto.edu/\">University of Toronto</a> and <a href=\"https://vectorinstitute.ai\">Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>, working with <a href=\"https://brudno.uhndata.io/">Prof. Michael Brudno</a>. My research interests lie in developing practical solutions for the adoption of AI in real-world applications. During my masters, I focused on utilizing machine learning techniques to tackle healthcare challenges and identifying barriers that prevent the deployment of these algorithms in real-world settings."
