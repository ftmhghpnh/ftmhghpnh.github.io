      <li> To assist diagnosis of neurodevelopmental impairments, I developed  a generalized novel algorithm to detect cerebral microbleeds (CMB) in MRI modality from pre-term infants' brains. </li>
      <li> To expedite the diagnosis of brain tumors in children in hospital emergency rooms, where wait times can be lengthy, I developed a machine learning model for identifying signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in ocular point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) images.  </li>

      <li> In order to have a better understanding of neonatal brain development, I implemented machine learning algorithms to segment different regions and tissues of an infant's brain. </li>
      <li> To improve MRI safety, I developed a novel algorithm to segment different tissues of whole-body using various MRI scan modalities, which can be used to track specific tissue temperature increases during MRI scan. </li>

      <li> To improve the relevancy of search results which leads to a better user experience, as the project owner, I developed an innovative search algorithm that utilizes semantic networks and word embedding.</li>
      <li> Refine user queries and optimize search filters for different categories to enhance the search experience by utilizing behavioral pattern analysis of unstructured data from user action logs. </li>
      <li> To assist human reviewers in finding duplicate listings and removing them from the platform, we developed a machine learning-based image search algorithm using Convolutional Neural Networks.</li>
