projects:
  - name: Chest-Xray-Analysis
    description: In my project, I developed a deep neural network architecture to automatically identify important chest diseases from X-ray images, which is critical for screening, diagnosis and managing life-threatening diseases. This innovative approach has the potential to aid medical professionals in recognizing different diseases and improve patient outcomes. The performance of the model was evaluated against previous works, demonstrating comparable results.
