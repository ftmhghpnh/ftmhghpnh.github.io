    role: "Graduate Research Assistant"
    start: "Jun 2019"
    end: "Present"
    description: "<ul class='text-gray mb-2 ws-normal pl-3'>
      <li> Designed and implemented a suite of novel automated accessibility testing tools for Android apps, utilizing machine learning techniques, as well as static and dynamic analysis methods.</li>
      <li> Conducted extensive research into the use of image captioning for labeling unlabeled icons in Android apps, and identified a data-driven bias in the existing approach. Developed a novel deep learning solution, which significantly improved the quality of the generated labels.</li>
      <li> Designed and implemented a deep learning-based technique using PyTorch for building an oracle for energy tests. </li>
    </ul>"

  - company: "Candelis Inc."

    description: "<ul class='text-gray mb-2 ws-normal pl-3'>
      <li>Designed and implemented the DICOMWeb standard, enabling web-based access to DICOM data. This involved developing the Store, Retrieve, and Query APIs as a new service.
 </li>
      <li> Implemented a cost-efficient archive and backup mechanism for the DICOM data using various Amazon S3 storage classes. This involved designing a data lifecycle management strategy and utilizing Amazon S3's Intelligent-Tiering and Glacier storage classes to optimize storage costs.</li>
      <li> Integrated Prometheus for time-series monitoring of key performance metrics, and utilized Grafana to visualize the data and gain insights into the system behavior. </li>
